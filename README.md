# GFDY

This repository includes the scripts to analyse the links between growth and biomass.

We use observations from Swiss forests and simulations from a demography vegetation model (LM3-PPA).

The repository is organized as follows:

data - includes the scripts for data cleaning and the clean data which is used in analysis.
analysis - includes the scripts for data analysis.
manuscript - includes figures and other outputs.
R - overall functions which are recycled.
src - not R specific functions.
